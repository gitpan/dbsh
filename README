dbsh 0.01
(c) Copyright 2001 by Milan Sorm, sorm@pef.mendelu.cz

If you plan to use this program you must respect LICENSE file.

This software works like database shell like file manager over database.

Depends on installation of Tk, FindBin, DBIx::SystemCatalog, DBI 
and some DBD driver.

You need DBIx::SystemCatalog from SchemaView-Plus for fetching system catalog
information. Version 0.06 and newer can emulate fs for dbsh.

Please read manual page for dbsh for more information.

To install make

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Than run

	dbsh
